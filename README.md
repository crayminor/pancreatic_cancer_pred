The key features are four urinary biomarkers: creatinine, LYVE1, REG1A & REG1B, and TFF1.

Creatinine is a protein that is often used as an indicator of kidney function.
YVLE1 is lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, a protein that may play a role in tumor metastasis
REG1B is a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration
TFF1 is trefoil factor 1, which may be related to regeneration and repair of the urinary tract
